This is based on the TextMate bundle found on [this](https://github.com/bburbach/textmate-freemarker-bundle) repo.

It supports lots of snippets: **#if, #else, #assign, #switch, #list**... Just type **#** followed by the first letters of a name of a FreeMarker tag and the editor will propose you all the available autocomplete options.
